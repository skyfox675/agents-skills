name: xlsx
description: "Use this skill any time a spreadsheet file is the primary input or output. This means any task where the user wants to: open, read, edit, or fix an existing .xlsx, .xlsm, .csv, or .tsv file (e.g., adding columns, computing formulas, formatting, charting, cleaning messy data); create a new spreadsheet from scratch or from other data sources; or convert between tabular file formats. Trigger especially when the user references a spreadsheet file by name or path — even casually (like \"the xlsx in my downloads\") — and wants something done to it or produced from it. Also trigger for cleaning or restructuring messy tabular data files (malformed rows, misplaced headers, junk data) into proper spreadsheets. The deliverable must be a spreadsheet file. Do NOT trigger when the primary deliverable is a Word document, HTML report, standalone Python script, database pipeline, or Google Sheets API integration, even if tabular data is involved."

# xlsx (pointer skill)

Pointer skill — the implementation is **not** stored here. The `name` above is the stable local contract; the body lives upstream and is fetched/installed from source so consumers always get the latest version.

- **Canonical source:** https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skills/xlsx/SKILL.md
- **Raw SKILL.md:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/skills/main/skills/xlsx/SKILL.md
- **What it does:** Create, modify, and analyze Excel/CSV spreadsheets with formulas, professional formatting, charts, and error validation.
- **License:** see the anthropics/skills repo LICENSE.

## Installing this skill

- **Claude Code (recommended):** `/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills`, then `/plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills` — this skill ships in the **document-skills** plugin.
- **Claude.ai (paid plans):** already available, no install.
- **Claude API:** upload/enable via the Skills API.
- **Cursor / GitHub Copilot:** copy `skills/xlsx/` from anthropics/skills into your skills dir (`.cursor/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, or the shared `.claude/skills/`).

Do not copy the upstream body into this file; that would freeze the version and defeat the pointer.
