name: pptx
description: "Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates, layouts, speaker notes, or comments. Trigger whenever the user mentions \"deck,\" \"slides,\" \"presentation,\" or references a .pptx filename, regardless of what they plan to do with the content afterward. If a .pptx file needs to be opened, created, or touched, use this skill."

# pptx (pointer skill)

Pointer skill — the implementation is **not** stored here. The `name` above is the stable local contract; the body lives upstream and is fetched/installed from source so consumers always get the latest version.

- **Canonical source:** https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skills/pptx/SKILL.md
- **Raw SKILL.md:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/skills/main/skills/pptx/SKILL.md
- **What it does:** Create, edit, analyze, and manipulate PowerPoint presentations with design guidance and quality-assurance workflows.
- **License:** Proprietary — see upstream LICENSE.txt for complete terms.

## Installing this skill

- **Claude Code (recommended):** `/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills`, then `/plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills` — this skill ships in the **document-skills** plugin.
- **Claude.ai (paid plans):** already available, no install.
- **Claude API:** upload/enable via the Skills API.
- **Cursor / GitHub Copilot:** copy `skills/pptx/` from anthropics/skills into your skills dir (`.cursor/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, or the shared `.claude/skills/`).

Do not copy the upstream body into this file; that would freeze the version and defeat the pointer.
